### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted project link here]

### Project Description
[Our project aims to develop a Chrome extension that protects users from falling victim to fake websites offering fraudulent rewards or gifts. These websites, often spread via messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or social media platforms, lure users with false promises and can lead to data theft or scams.]

### The Problem statement
[ websites, often spread via messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or social media platforms, lure users with false promises and can lead to data theft or scams.]

### The Solution
[The NoCap extension will:

*Detect Fake Links: Use APIs (like PhishTank, Google Safe Browsing) and datasets of known malicious URLs to identify harmful websites in real-time.

*Analyze Content Patterns: Scan websites for phishing patterns, such as overly capitalized comments, generic usernames, or common scam phrases like ‚ÄúI got the gift today.‚Äù

*Warn Users: Display a warning when users visit suspected malicious websites, notifying them with messages like:
"This website is flagged as potentially fake or harmful. Proceed with caution or return to safety."

*Indicate Safe Sites: Provide reassurance for legitimate websites with a ‚ÄúSafe Website‚Äù label]
